Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet because they provide vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that the body needs to function properly. Regular consumption helps strengthen the immune system, improve digestion, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Their natural nutrients support overall growth and well-being, making them important for people of all ages.

Fruits and vegetables are rich in essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and dietary fiber. Leafy vegetables such as spinach and broccoli support bone and eye health, while fruits like oranges and bananas provide energy and hydration. The variety of colors found in fruits and vegetables often indicates different nutrients, which is why eating a wide range is recommended for balanced nutrition.
